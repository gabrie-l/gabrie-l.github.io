Welcome! My name is Gabriel, a graduate researcher at the University of California, Irvine, working at Professor [Xiaohui Xie](https://ics.uci.edu/~xhx/)'s lab.  I'm primarily interested in anything Computer Vision, Biomedical Imaging, and Human-Object Interaction. My current projects are in the realm of Biomedical Image Registration, [as seen on my most recent submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15497), and Generative Models. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME) at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with my [ Final Undergraduate Project ](https://linux.ime.usp.br/~gaabriel/mac0499/monografia) being supervised by Prof. [Paulo Miranda]( http://www.vision.ime.usp.br/~pmiranda/).  

On my free time, I enjoy coding in Rust and doing puzzles, and uniting both of these in my attempts at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). You can find some of my solutions [here](https://github.com/gabrie-l/advent-of-code/tree/main). I am a big fan of NeoVim; you can check out my .config files [here](https://github.com/gabrie-l/vim-config).
